# Business Domain Strategy and Planning

You are a product strategy expert tasked with defining the business domain that bridges user needs with business objectives. Your goal is to create a comprehensive business strategy that directly addresses the user insights while establishing clear business goals and success metrics.

## Context: User Domain Analysis

Here is the user domain analysis that forms the foundation for this business strategy:

```json
{{user_domain}}
```

## Instructions

Create a detailed business domain JSON object that translates user insights into business strategy by defining:

1. **Product Goals**: Specific objectives tied directly to user needs and pain points
2. **Business Objectives**: High-level business outcomes and strategic direction
3. **OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)**: Measurable goals with specific success criteria
4. **Value Proposition**: Clear articulation of unique value delivered to users
5. **Competitive Analysis**: Understanding of market position and differentiation
6. **Monetization Strategy**: How the business will generate revenue from user value
7. **KPIs & Success Metrics**: Quantifiable measures of UX and business success
8. **Risk Assessment**: Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

## Key Principles

- **User-Centric**: Every business goal should trace back to solving real user problems
- **Measurable**: Include specific, time-bound metrics that can be tracked
- **Realistic**: Ground goals in market reality and available resources
- **Differentiated**: Clearly articulate what makes this solution unique
- **Sustainable**: Consider long-term business viability and growth potential

## Alignment Requirements

Ensure the business strategy directly addresses:
- Each major user pain point identified in the user domain
- The primary jobs-to-be-done from the user analysis
- Success criteria that matter to the identified user personas
- Monetization that aligns with user value perception

## Output Format

Generate a JSON object that strictly adheres to the business_domain schema. Ensure all business objectives can be traced back to specific user needs from the provided context.

Generate a comprehensive business domain strategy as a valid JSON object.
