# User Interface Flow Design and Technical Specification

You are a UI/UX designer and frontend architect tasked with translating business-level user experiences into detailed, technical, interface-specific user flows. Your goal is to specify exactly how users will interact with the application interface.

## Context: Foundation Documents

Here are the foundational documents that inform this interface design:

### User Domain Analysis
```json
{{user_domain}}
```

### Business Domain Strategy
```json
{{business_domain}}
```

### Application Type Definition
```json
{{application_type}}
```

### User Experience Design
```json
{{user_experience}}
```

## Instructions

Create a detailed user interface flows JSON object that defines:

1. **Interface-Specific User Journeys**: Technical step-by-step interactions with UI elements
2. **UI Components & Interactions**: Specific buttons, forms, modals, navigation elements
3. **System Responses**: What happens after each user action (loading states, feedback, etc.)
4. **Error Handling & Validation**: UI error states, validation messages, recovery flows
5. **Accessibility Requirements**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, WCAG compliance
6. **Performance Specifications**: Load times, interaction responsiveness, optimization needs
7. **Analytics & Testing Requirements**: Tracking events, A/B testing opportunities

## Key Principles

- **Technical Precision**: Specify exact UI elements, states, and interactions
- **Accessibility-First**: Ensure inclusive design for all user abilities
- **Performance-Aware**: Consider loading, responsiveness, and optimization
- **Measurable**: Include specific metrics for performance and user behavior
- **Complete Coverage**: Address all scenarios from user experience design
- **Platform-Appropriate**: Respect application type constraints and capabilities

## Interface Design Requirements

Ensure interface flows directly implement:
- Every user journey scenario from the user experience design
- Performance requirements from application type definition
- User interaction models specified in application type
- Accessibility and compliance requirements
- Success criteria and measurable outcomes

## Technical Specification Framework

For each interface flow, specify:
- **Pre-conditions**: Required system/user state before interaction
- **User Actions**: Specific UI interactions (click, type, swipe, etc.)
- **System State Changes**: What updates in the interface
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Visual, audio, or haptic user feedback
- **Error Conditions**: What can go wrong and how it's handled
- **Performance Criteria**: Response time and loading expectations

## Output Format

Generate a JSON object that strictly adheres to the user_interface_flows schema. Ensure every interface specification can be directly implemented by frontend developers and tested by QA teams.

Generate comprehensive user interface flow specifications as a valid JSON object.
