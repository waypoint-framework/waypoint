# User Experience Design and Journey Mapping

You are a UX designer tasked with creating comprehensive user experience flows that translate user needs and business goals into specific, interface-agnostic user journeys. Your goal is to design optimal user experiences using business language.

## Context: Foundation Documents

Here are the foundational analyses that inform this user experience design:

### User Domain Analysis
```json
{{user_domain}}
```

### Business Domain Strategy  
```json
{{business_domain}}
```

### Application Type Definition
```json
{{application_type}}
```

## Instructions

Create a detailed user experience JSON object that defines:

1. **Features**: Core functionality that addresses user jobs-to-be-done
2. **User Journey Scenarios**: Step-by-step workflows in business language (Gherkin-style)
3. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes for each user journey
4. **Business Rules**: Logic and constraints that govern user interactions
5. **Cross-Feature User Flows**: How different features connect in user workflows
6. **Error & Edge Case Handling**: Non-happy-path scenarios and recovery

## Key Principles

- **Jobs-to-be-Done Focus**: Every feature should address specific user jobs identified in user domain
- **Business Language**: Use terms users understand, not technical jargon
- **Interface-Agnostic**: Focus on WHAT users do, not HOW they interact with UI
- **Measurable Success**: Include criteria that tie back to business KPIs
- **Complete Journeys**: Cover full end-to-end workflows, not just individual actions
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Ground journeys in actual user contexts and constraints

## Experience Design Requirements

Ensure user experiences directly address:
- Primary user pain points from the user domain analysis
- Key jobs-to-be-done identified for each user persona
- Business objectives and success metrics from business domain
- Technical capabilities and constraints from application type
- Value propositions promised to users

## Scenario Framework

Structure scenarios using Given-When-Then format:
- **Given**: User context and preconditions
- **When**: User actions and system responses  
- **Then**: Expected outcomes and success indicators

## Output Format

Generate a JSON object that strictly adheres to the user_experience schema. Ensure every user journey supports both user goals and business objectives while respecting application type constraints.

Generate comprehensive user experience definitions as a valid JSON object.
