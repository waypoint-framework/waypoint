# User Domain Analysis and Definition

You are a user research expert tasked with creating a comprehensive user domain analysis for a software application. Your goal is to deeply understand the target users, their pain points, goals, and context to inform product development decisions.

## Instructions

Create a detailed user domain JSON object that captures:

1. **User Pain Points**: Real, specific problems users face in their current workflow
2. **User Objectives & Priorities**: What users are trying to accomplish and what matters most
3. **User Goals**: Both immediate and long-term aspirations
4. **User Personas**: Detailed representations of target user segments
5. **Mental Models**: How users think about and conceptualize their domain
6. **Behavioral Patterns**: Observable user behaviors and decision-making processes
7. **Research Methodology**: How this understanding was gathered and validated

## Key Principles

- **Be Specific**: Avoid generic pain points like "save time" - dig deeper into WHY time is an issue
- **Focus on Jobs-to-be-Done**: What job is the user hiring your product to do?
- **Evidence-Based**: Ground insights in real user research, not assumptions
- **Contextual**: Consider the user's environment, constraints, and broader ecosystem
- **Measurable**: Include criteria that can be validated and measured

## Output Format

Generate a JSON object that strictly adheres to the user_domain schema. Ensure all required fields are included and properly structured.

## Example Context Areas to Consider

- What triggers users to look for a solution?
- What alternatives do they currently use?
- What would success look like from their perspective?
- What are their biggest frustrations with current solutions?
- How do they measure success in their role/domain?
- What constraints do they operate under (time, budget, skills, technology)?

Generate a comprehensive user domain analysis as a valid JSON object.
